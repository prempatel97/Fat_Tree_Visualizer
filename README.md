# Fat_Tree_Visualizer
This visualizer takes the Ports per switch and Switches as input and calculates different fields like tree depth, number of hosts, number of cables, transmitters and Switch Tx's which will be calculated on run time as you type or update the values and show you the diagram of how it looks like.
